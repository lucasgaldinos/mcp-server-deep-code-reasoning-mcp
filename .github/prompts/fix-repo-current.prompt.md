## Rules

- [MANDATORY] When asked to follow instructions step by step, break down the task into clear steps, selecting the appropriate tools and fallbacks (multiple if needed) from your tool list for each step.
  - The available tools are in `.github/.knowledge_base/0-tool_usage/1-simple_tool_list.md`.
  - You will also find more information about each tool in `.github/.knowledge_base/0-tool_usage/tools_and_mcps.md`.
- [MANDATORY] Always prefer tools that are specialized for the task at hand, rather than general-purpose tools.
- [MANDATORY] You are obliged to #think and `optimize tool selection`[^1] before executing any task where tools are not explictly set.

## Summary of Comprehensive Implementation Guide

### ðŸ“‹ **Implementation Structure Created**

#### **Phase-Based Execution Plan**

```txt
Phase 1: Foundation Stabilization (task robust plan 1 - needs task breakdown)
â”œâ”€â”€ Environment standardization (.env.example, path mapping)
â”œâ”€â”€ Error boundaries implementation  
â””â”€â”€ Basic observability (health checks, metrics)

Phase 2: Architecture Patterns (task robust plan 2 - needs task breakdown-3)
â”œâ”€â”€ Dependency injection container
â”œâ”€â”€ Repository pattern for file access
â””â”€â”€ Circuit breaker for Gemini API

Phase 3: Performance & Scalability (task robust plan 4 - needs task breakdown)
â”œâ”€â”€ Caching layer implementation
â”œâ”€â”€ Parallel processing for multiple files
â””â”€â”€ Resource optimization

Phase 4: Observability & Monitoring (task robust plan 5 - needs task breakdown)
â”œâ”€â”€ Structured logging
â”œâ”€â”€ Request tracing
â””â”€â”€ Performance metrics

Phase 5: Testing & Documentation (task robust plan 6 - needs task breakdown)
â”œâ”€â”€ Comprehensive test suite (>80% coverage)
â”œâ”€â”€ API documentation with TypeDoc
â””â”€â”€ Architectural decision records
```

### ðŸ”§ **Rules & Guidelines Established**

#### **Development Rules**

1. **Test-First Development**: Write tests before implementing features
2. **Code Review Required**: All changes require review before merge
3. **Breaking Changes**: Must be documented and versioned appropriately
4. **Performance Impact**: Measure performance impact of all changes
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain API compatibility where possible

#### **Quality Gates**

1. **Build Success**: All builds must pass
2. **Test Coverage**: Minimum 80% coverage required
3. **Linting**: No ESLint errors allowed
4. **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript compliance
5. **Performance**: No regression in analysis speed

#### **Integration Points**

1. **MCP Protocol**: Maintain full MCP specification compliance
2. **External APIs**: All external calls must use circuit breakers
3. **File System**: All file access through repository pattern
4. **Logging**: All operations must be logged with correlation IDs
5. **Error Handling**: All errors must be properly classified and handled

#### **Ready to Execute**

1. **Start Phase 1 Implementation**: Environment setup and error boundaries
2. **Create Development Branch**: `feature/phase-1-foundation`
3. **Begin Task 1.1**: Create .env.example and TypeScript path mapping
4. **Implement Task 1.2**: Centralized error handling system

#### **Resources Available**

- **Detailed Task Instructions**: Each task includes specific code examples and acceptance criteria
- **Risk Mitigation Plans**: Technical and process risks identified with mitigation strategies
- **Integration Guidance**: Clear connection points with MCP ecosystem
- **Quality Assurance**: Automated gates and continuous monitoring plans

### ðŸŽ¯ **Long-term Vision**

The comprehensive guide provides a 6-task robust plan roadmap to transform the repository from a functional prototype into a production-ready, enterprise-grade MCP server with:

- **Robust Architecture**: Proper design patterns and error handling
- **High Performance**: Caching, parallel processing, and optimization
- **Production Ready**: Monitoring, testing, and documentation
- **Ecosystem Integration**: Seamless integration with other MCP servers

**The implementation guide is complete and ready for execution.** All necessary documentation, examples, and success criteria have been provided for systematic, high-quality improvement of the repository.
