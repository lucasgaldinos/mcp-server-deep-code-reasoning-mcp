## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **DCR-13: Comprehensive Testing Infrastructure Implementation**: Modernized testing infrastructure using MCP deep-code-reasoning tools for systematic analysis and resolution
  - **MCP Tool Validation**: Successfully tested 11/14 MCP tools with 79% success rate
  - **Jest-to-Vitest Migration Strategy**: Established conversion template with ConfigurationManager.test.ts showing 83% test improvement (20/24 vs 0/24 passing)
  - **Performance Baseline Establishment**: Used hypothesis_test, performance_bottleneck, and trace_execution_path tools for comprehensive testing analysis
