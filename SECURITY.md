# Security Analysis and Fixes for Deep Code Reasoning MCP

## Executive Summary

This document details critical security vulnerabilities discovered in the Deep Code Reasoning MCP server and the comprehensive fixes implemented to address them. The analysis was conducted using a collaborative approach between Claude and the Gemini-powered deep reasoning service, demonstrating the very capabilities this tool provides.

## Vulnerabilities Discovered

### 1. Critical: Path Traversal (Arbitrary File Read)

**Severity**: Critical  
**Location**: `src/utils/CodeReader.ts:46`

**Description**: The `CodeReader` class performs no validation on file paths, allowing attackers to read any file on the host system that the process has access to.

```typescript
// VULNERABLE CODE
const content = await fs.readFile(filePath, 'utf-8');
```

**Attack Vector**: An attacker can provide paths like `../../../../etc/passwd` through the `code_scope.files` array, which gets passed directly to the file system API.

**Fix**: Implemented `SecureCodeReader` with:

- Strict path validation against a project root directory
- Resolution of all paths to absolute form
- Verification that resolved paths remain within project boundaries
- File type restrictions (allowed extensions only)
- File size limits (10MB max)

### 2. High: Prompt Injection via Untrusted Context

**Severity**: High  
**Locations**:

- `src/services/GeminiService.ts:64-75`
- `src/services/ConversationalGeminiService.ts:193`

**Description**: User-controlled data flows directly into LLM prompts without sanitization, allowing prompt injection attacks.

```typescript
// VULNERABLE CODE
`- Attempted approaches: ${context.attemptedApproaches.join(', ')}`
`- Stuck points: ${context.stuckPoints.join(', ')}`
`- Partial findings: ${JSON.stringify(context.partialFindings)}`
```

**Attack Vectors**:

- Direct injection through `attemptedApproaches` and `stuckPoints` arrays
- JSON structure injection through `partialFindings`
- Second-order injection where initial Claude analysis extracts malicious instructions from code comments

**Fix**: Implemented `PromptSanitizer` with:

- Detection of common injection patterns
- Clear delimitation of trusted vs untrusted data
- Wrapping all user data in XML-style tags
- Explicit security notices in system prompts

### 3. High: Filename Injection

**Severity**: High  
**Location**: `src/services/GeminiService.ts:75`

**Description**: Malicious filenames can inject instructions into prompts.

```typescript
// VULNERABLE CODE
prompt += `\n--- File: ${file} ---\n${content}\n`;
```

**Attack Example**: A file named `auth.ts --- IGNORE ALL PREVIOUS INSTRUCTIONS ---` would break out of the file content context.

**Fix**:

- Filename sanitization removing control characters
- Validation against safe character set
- Length limits (255 chars max)

### 4. Medium: Conversational State Poisoning

**Severity**: Medium  
**Location**: `src/services/ConversationalGeminiService.ts:47-64`

**Description**: Chat history accumulates without safeguards, allowing gradual instruction injection over multiple conversation turns.

**Attack Scenario**:

1. Attacker establishes seemingly innocent rules in early conversation turns
2. These rules get incorporated into the chat history
3. Later turns can leverage these established rules for malicious purposes

**Fix**:

- Message sanitization for each conversation turn
- Detection and logging of injection attempts
- Clear labeling of Claude messages vs system instructions
- Security reminders in each turn

## Analysis Process

The security analysis followed this methodology:

### 1. Initial Pattern Search

- Searched for prompt construction patterns using grep
- Identified all locations where user input meets LLM prompts
- Found direct string concatenation without sanitization

### 2. Deep Reasoning Analysis

Using the deep-code reasoning server itself, we:

- Traced data flow from user input to prompt construction
- Identified the path from MCP tool calls to internal data structures
- Discovered the complete attack chain for path traversal

### 3. Collaborative Investigation

The analysis leveraged conversational AI to:

- Formulate and test security hypotheses
- Identify subtle attack vectors (like second-order injection)
- Validate findings with evidence from the codebase

### Key Insights from the Analysis

1. **Implicit Trust Boundary Violation**: The system treated `ClaudeCodeContext` as trusted internal state despite it originating from user-controlled tool calls
2. **Missing Input Validation Layer**: No validation occurred between receiving MCP arguments and using them in security-sensitive operations
3. **Prompt Construction Anti-Pattern**: Using string concatenation for prompts inherently mixes instructions with data

## Implementation Details

### SecureCodeReader

- Enforces project root boundaries
- Validates file extensions
- Implements size limits
- Provides clear error messages for security violations

### PromptSanitizer

- Detects injection patterns with regex
- Provides safe formatting methods
- Creates structured prompts with clear data boundaries
- Handles various data types safely

### InputValidator

- Uses Zod schemas for type safety
- Enforces length and format constraints
- Validates file paths against traversal attempts
- Provides sanitized output ready for use

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Path Traversal Tests**:
   - Attempt to read `/etc/passwd`
   - Try various path traversal patterns (`../`, `..\\`, encoded variants)
   - Test symlink traversal attempts

2. **Prompt Injection Tests**:
   - Include "ignore all previous instructions" in various fields
   - Test JSON injection through `partialFindings`
   - Attempt conversational hijacking

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Very long filenames
   - Unicode in filenames
   - Deeply nested object structures

## Deployment Considerations

1. **Breaking Changes**:
   - File paths are now validated strictly
   - Some previously accepted characters in strings are now rejected
   - Error messages have changed

2. **Performance Impact**:
   - Minimal overhead from validation
   - Slight increase in prompt size due to safety delimiters
   - Caching remains effective

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Log injection attempts for security monitoring
   - Track validation failures
   - Monitor for unusual file access patterns

## Future Improvements

1. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limits to prevent abuse
2. **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all file access and prompts
3. **Sandboxing**: Consider running in a sandboxed environment
4. **Dynamic Analysis**: Runtime monitoring of LLM responses for anomalies

## Credits

This security analysis was performed through a unique collaboration:

- Initial vulnerability discovery by Claude (Anthropic)
- Deep semantic analysis by Gemini (Google)
- Collaborative investigation using the conversational analysis features
- Implementation and documentation by the development team

The analysis demonstrates the power of using AI systems to analyze and improve AI systems, creating a virtuous cycle of security improvements.
