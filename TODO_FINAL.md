### Phase 3: Performance and Caching (Current Priority)

The next implementation phase focuses on performance optimization and caching:

#### Planned Implementations

1. **Analysis Caching System**
   - [ ] Create `src/cache/AnalysisCache.ts` with TTL support
   - [ ] Implement caching for frequently accessed files and analysis results
   - [ ] Add cache invalidation strategies and memory management

2. **Memory Management**
   - [ ] Implement conversation history cleanup mechanisms
   - [ ] Add memory usage monitoring and alerting
   - [ ] Optimize large code analysis operations

3. **Performance Monitoring**
   - [ ] Add performance metrics collection
   - [ ] Implement resource usage tracking
   - [ ] Add automatic resource cleanup for long-running sessions

### Phase 4: Testing and Quality

Future testing and quality improvements:

- [ ] **Comprehensive Unit Testing**: Add tests for all analyzer modules with proper mocking
- [ ] **Integration Testing**: End-to-end conversation flows and multi-service validation
- [ ] **Performance Benchmarks**: Critical operations benchmarking
- [ ] **Quality Metrics**: Target 80% test coverage, 90% documentation coverage

### Phase 5: Extensibility

Future extensibility enhancements:

- [ ] **Plugin Architecture**: Create `src/plugins/PluginManager.ts` for extensible analysis
- [ ] **Multi-Server Integration**: Patterns and workflow orchestration
- [ ] **Advanced Features**: Custom domain-specific analyzers
