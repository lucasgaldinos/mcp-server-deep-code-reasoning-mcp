# Testing Infrastructure

This directory contains the testing infrastructure and frameworks that support comprehensive testing throughout the Deep Code Reasoning MCP project.

## Purpose

This directory provides **testing tools and frameworks**, not test cases themselves. It contains reusable components that support:

- Integration testing frameworks
- Performance benchmarking tools
- Quality assurance utilities
- Test orchestration and coordination

## Components

### Integration Test Framework (`integration-test-framework.ts`)

**Purpose**: Provides infrastructure for end-to-end testing of complete analysis workflows.

**Capabilities**:

- End-to-end workflow testing
- MCP protocol integration testing
- Service interaction validation
- External API integration testing

**Usage**:

```typescript
import { IntegrationTestFramework } from './integration-test-framework.js';

const framework = new IntegrationTestFramework();
await framework.testCompleteAnalysisWorkflow({
  analysisType: 'execution_trace',
  codeFiles: ['src/example.ts']
});
```

### Performance Benchmark (`performance-benchmark.ts`)

**Purpose**: Comprehensive performance testing and benchmarking infrastructure.

**Capabilities**:

- Memory usage monitoring
- Execution time benchmarking
- Resource consumption tracking
- Performance regression detection
- Statistical analysis of performance data

**Features**:

- Real-time memory leak detection
- CPU usage monitoring
- I/O operation tracking
- Performance baseline establishment

**Usage**:

```typescript
import { PerformanceBenchmark } from './performance-benchmark.js';

const benchmark = new PerformanceBenchmark();
const results = await benchmark.measureAnalysisPerformance(analysisFunction);
```

### Quality Assurance (`quality-assurance.ts`)

**Purpose**: Code quality validation and metrics collection framework.

**Capabilities**:

- Code coverage analysis
- Complexity metrics
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Quality gate enforcement
- Maintainability index calculation

**Quality Metrics**:

- Line and branch coverage percentages
- Cyclomatic complexity analysis
- Security audit integration
- Documentation coverage
- Technical debt assessment

**Usage**:

```typescript
import { QualityAssurance } from './quality-assurance.js';

const qa = new QualityAssurance();
const qualityReport = await qa.generateQualityReport();
```

### Test Suite Runner (`test-suite-runner.ts`)

**Purpose**: Orchestrates and coordinates different types of tests across the project.

**Capabilities**:

- Unit test coordination
- Integration test execution
- Performance test scheduling
- Test result aggregation
- Cross-test-type reporting

**Test Types Coordinated**:

- Unit tests from `src/__tests__/`
- Integration tests from `tests/`
- Performance benchmarks
- Quality assurance checks

**Usage**:

```typescript
import { TestSuiteRunner } from './test-suite-runner.js';

const runner = new TestSuiteRunner();
const results = await runner.runComprehensiveTestSuite();
```

## Testing Infrastructure Architecture

```

### How Infrastructure Supports Testing

1. **Unit Tests** use infrastructure for:
   - Performance monitoring during test execution
   - Quality metrics collection
   - Integration test coordination

2. **Integration Tests** use infrastructure for:
   - End-to-end workflow orchestration
   - Cross-service communication testing
   - Performance baseline validation

3. **Development Workflow** uses infrastructure for:
   - Continuous quality monitoring
   - Performance regression detection
   - Comprehensive test reporting

## Configuration and Setup

### Environment Requirements

- Node.js with ES module support
- TypeScript compilation setup
- Access to external services (for integration testing)
- Performance monitoring permissions

### Configuration Files

Related configuration files:

- `config/build/vitest.config.ts` - Test runner configuration
- `config/quality/` - Quality assurance configuration
- `.env.test` - Test environment variables

## Development Usage

### Adding New Testing Infrastructure

1. **Create New Framework**: Add new .ts file in this directory
2. **Export Functionality**: Ensure proper ES module exports
3. **Document Usage**: Add documentation and examples
4. **Integrate with Runner**: Update test-suite-runner.ts if needed

### Using Existing Infrastructure

1. **Import Framework**: Import needed testing tools
2. **Configure for Test**: Set up framework for specific test needs
3. **Execute Tests**: Use framework methods in test files
4. **Collect Results**: Gather metrics and reports

## Best Practices

### Framework Design

- **Single Responsibility**: Each framework handles one testing concern
- **Reusability**: Design for use across multiple test types
- **Configuration**: Support flexible configuration options
- **Reporting**: Provide comprehensive result reporting

### Performance Considerations

- **Efficient Monitoring**: Minimal overhead during test execution
- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup after test execution
- **Parallel Execution**: Support for concurrent test execution
- **Memory Management**: Prevent memory leaks in long test runs

### Integration Guidelines

- **Standard Interfaces**: Use consistent APIs across frameworks
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error reporting and recovery
- **Logging**: Detailed logging for debugging test issues
- **Metrics Collection**: Standardized metrics format

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Performance Monitoring Overhead**: If tests run slowly, check monitoring configuration
2. **Integration Test Failures**: Verify external service availability and configuration
3. **Quality Gate Failures**: Check quality thresholds and coverage requirements
4. **Memory Issues**: Monitor for memory leaks in long-running test suites

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging for framework debugging:

```bash
DEBUG=testing:* npm test
NODE_ENV=test npm test
```

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Infrastructure Additions

1. **Visual Testing Framework**: For UI component testing
2. **Contract Testing Framework**: For API integration testing
3. **Chaos Engineering Framework**: For reliability testing
4. **AI-Assisted Test Generation**: For automated test creation

### Framework Improvements

1. **Enhanced Performance Monitoring**: More detailed metrics
2. **Better Quality Gates**: More sophisticated quality checks
3. **Improved Integration Testing**: Better external service mocking
4. **Advanced Reporting**: Rich HTML reports and dashboards

This testing infrastructure enables comprehensive, efficient, and maintainable testing throughout the Deep Code Reasoning MCP project.
